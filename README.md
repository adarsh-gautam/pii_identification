# Project Title:- Web Enabled Search Tool for Identifying PII

## Abstract:

Safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) is crucial because such information is increasingly used to engineer privacy attacks, identity thefts and security breaches. But is it likely that individuals may choose to just share this information with strangers? We find that individuals not only reciprocate and share PII when the disclosure of such information is private and directed towards them by a stranger, but also when the stranger shares this information through a public channel that is not directed towards anyone in particular. The project focus to Identify personally identifiable information on such public or open web sites and notifying user about the availability .
